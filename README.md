YAML for Java 8 and above. Based on [spec 1.2](http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html).

From the [specification](http://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html): **YAMLâ„¢** is a human-friendly, cross language, Unicode based data serialization language.

To get the latest release from Maven Central, simply add the following to your ``pom.xml``: 

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.amihaiemil.web</groupId>
    <artifactId>eo-yaml</artifactId>
    <version>8.0.1</version>
</dependency>
```

or download the <a href="https://oss.sonatype.org/service/local/repositories/releases/content/com/amihaiemil/web/eo-yaml/8.0.1/eo-yaml-8.0.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar">fat</a> jar.

If you use Gradle, add this to your dependencies:

```gradle
implementation group: 'com.amihaiemil.web', name: 'eo-yaml', version: '8.0.1'
```

The releases are also available on [Github Packages](https://github.com/decorators-squad/eo-yaml/packages)!

## Usage

The API of this library is clean, intuitive and generally close to the ``javax.json`` API that most developers are used to.
Just start from the ``com.amihaiemil.eoyaml.Yaml`` class, it offers all the builders and readers you may need.

See the [Block Style Yaml](https://github.com/decorators-squad/eo-yaml/wiki/Block-Style-YAML) wiki for a first glance.

## Features detailed (ongoing work!)

Here is what we have so far:

* Building and Reading Block YAML ([wiki](https://github.com/decorators-squad/eo-yaml/wiki/Block-Style-YAML));
* Flow-style/JSON-Like representation ([wiki](https://github.com/decorators-squad/eo-yaml/wiki/Flow-Style-(JSON%E2%80%90like)-YAML));
* Support for Folded and Literal Block Scalars ([wiki](https://github.com/decorators-squad/eo-yaml/wiki/Folded-and-Literal-Block-Scalars));
* Convenience Type-Casting Methods ([wiki](https://github.com/decorators-squad/eo-yaml/wiki/Convenience-Type-Casting-Methods));
* Support for Comments ([wiki](https://github.com/decorators-squad/eo-yaml/wiki/Support-For-Comments));
* Convenient ``YamlPrinter`` ([wiki](https://github.com/decorators-squad/eo-yaml/wiki/YAML-Printer));
* Easy Extension Thanks to Interfaces ([wiki](https://github.com/decorators-squad/eo-yaml/wiki/Easy-Extension-Via-Interfaces));
* Building and Reading YAML Streams, integrated with Java 8's Stream API ([wiki](https://github.com/decorators-squad/eo-yaml/wiki/YAML-Streams));
* Java Beans to YAML ([wiki](https://github.com/decorators-squad/eo-yaml/wiki/Java-Bean-To-YAML));
* YAML Visitor ([wiki](https://github.com/decorators-squad/eo-yaml/wiki/YAML-Visitor));
* Others:
    - Clear and detailed Exceptions. For instance, in the case of bad indentation, it will tell you exactly which line is problematic and why.
    - Fully encapsulated. The user works only with a few Java Interfaces.
    - All objects are immutable and thread-safe.
    - It can be used as a **Java Module** (if you're on JDK 9+).
    - It is **lightweight**! It has 0 dependencies.

Here is what we're **still missing and working on**:

* Aliases, anchors and tags
* YAML to Java Bean

**Keep in mind** that the library is based on interfaces and OOP best practices, so you can probably extend/decorate the objects in order to create the functionality you need, if it's not yet implemented. 

If you have some time and like the library, please consider contributing.
